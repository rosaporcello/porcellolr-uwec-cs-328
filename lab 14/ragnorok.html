<h3>Völuspá</h3>
<h4>Stanzas 40–58</h4>
<p>The giantess old | in Ironwood sat,<br>In the east, and bore | the brood of Fenrir;<br>Among these one | in monster's guise<br>Was soon to steal | the sun from the sky.</p>
<p>There feeds he full | on the flesh of the dead,<br>And the home of the gods | he reddens with gore;<br>Dark grows the sun, | and in summer soon<br>Come mighty storms: | would you know yet more?</p>
<p>On a hill there sat, | and smote on his harp,<br>Eggther the joyous, | the giants' warder;<br>Above him the cock | in the bird-wood crowed,<br>Fair and red | did Fjalar stand.</p>
<p>Then to the gods | crowed Gollinkambi,<br>He wakes the heroes | in Othin's hall;<br>And beneath the earth | does another crow,<br>The rust-red bird | at the bars of Hel.</p>
<p>Now Garm howls loud | before Gnipahellir,<br>The fetters will burst, | and the wolf run free;<br>Much do I know, | and more can see<br>Of the fate of the gods, | the mighty in fight.</p>
<p>Brothers shall fight | and fell each other,<br>And sisters' sons | shall kinship stain;<br>Hard is it on earth, | with mighty whoredom;<br>Axe-time, sword-time, | shields are sundered,</p>
<p>Wind-time, wolf-time, | ere the world falls;<br>Nor ever shall men | each other spare.</p>
<p>Fast move the sons | of Mim, and fate<br>Is heard in the note | of the Gjallarhorn;<br>Loud blows Heimdall, | the horn is aloft,<br>In fear quake all | who on Hel-roads are.</p>
<p>Yggdrasil shakes, | and shiver on high<br>The ancient limbs, | and the giant is loose;<br>To the head of Mim | does Othin give heed,<br>But the kinsman of Surt | shall slay him soon.</p>
<p>How fare the gods? | how fare the elves?<br>All Jotunheim groans, | the gods are at council;<br>Loud roar the dwarfs | by the doors of stone,<br>The masters of the rocks: | would you know yet more?</p>
<p>Now Garm howls loud | before Gnipahellir,<br>The fetters will burst, | and the wolf run free;<br>Much do I know, | and more can see<br>Of the fate of the gods, | the mighty in fight.</p>
<p>From the east comes Hrym | with shield held high;<br>In giant-wrath | does the serpent writhe;<br>O'er the waves he twists, | and the tawny eagle<br>Gnaws corpses screaming; | Naglfar is loose.</p>
<p>O'er the sea from the east | there sails a ship<br>With the people of Muspell, | at the helm stands Loki;<br>After the wolf | do wild men follow,<br>And with them the brother | of Byleist goes.</p>
<p>Surt fares from the south | with the scourge of branches,<br>The sun of the battle-gods | shone from his sword;<br>The crags are sundered, | the giant-women sink,<br>The dead throng Hel-way, | and heaven is cloven.</p>
<p>Now comes to Hlin | yet another hurt,<br>When Othin fares | to fight with the wolf,<br>And Beli's fair slayer | seeks out Surt,<br>For there must fall | the joy of Frigg.</p>
<p>Then comes Sigfather's | mighty son,<br>Vithar, to fight | with the foaming wolf;<br>In the giant's son | does he thrust his sword<br>Full to the heart: | his father is avenged.</p>
