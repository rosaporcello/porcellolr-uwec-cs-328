        <h2>About Brunch</h2>

        <p>
            <strong>Our Mission</strong> - is to satisfy our neighbor's need for coffee and community by 
            providing high quality, direct trade coffee that we all can feel good about.
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong>Our Beans</strong> - are the result of direct trade. With a handshake, the farmer's crop is
            purchased for more than they could get on the open market. Through the Friend2Farmer initiative,
            better coffee is being created, along with a better quality of life for the farmers, their families 
            and their community. Due to the strong relationships being built, we are able to play a part in 
            helping fund local schools and other life-enriching projects within these communities. We believe 
            that nothing's better than waking up and knowing the delicious coffee you're drinking is helping to 
            brew better lives, better coffee and better communities all over the world.
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong>Distinctive and Bold</strong> - is to inspire a culture of generosity and authenticity; 
            helping to create the kind of community (local + worldwide) that we all want to call home. Locally, 
            by partnering and building strong relationships with local non-profits and businesses to meet the 
            needs of our neighbors. Worldwide, by ensuring that the farmers who provide us our coffee beans, 
            and the communities in which they are apart, are treated equitably.
