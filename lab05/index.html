  <h3>New Study Finds Americans Scoot Over At Least 10 Miles Per Year WASHINGTON</h3>
  <img src= lab05/images/scoot.jpg alt="Scooting study image" />
  <p>WASHINGTON—A new study published Wednesday by the Department of Transportation reveals that the average U.S. resident travels some 10 miles annually solely through the act of scooting over to make room for another person.  </p>
  <p>“Between park benches, bleachers, backseats, and various
other types of shared, communal seating, the typical American scoots nearly a mile a month,” said Department Secretary Anthony Foxx, who added that, taken all together, a
lifetimes worth of scooting over, sliding over, scooching, and
“making a bit more room” would equal the distance from the
nations capital to Orlando, FL. “The statistics are even
higher in the South, where picnic season is longer. And if you
count instances of scooting over, seeing the other person
has already found a place, and then scooting back, many
Americans travel farther by scooting than they do by motor
vehicle.” The studys methodology has come under fire from critics who argue it should have also counted situations in which sitters must
move their chair over to make room for someone who already has their own chair.</p>

    <h3>Black Guy Asks Nation For Change</h3>
    <img src= lab05/images/obama.jpg alt="Obama image"/>
    <p>CHICAGO—According to witnesses, a loud black man approached a crowd of
  some 4,000 strangers in downtown Chicago Tuesday and made repeated
demands for change.</p>
<p>"The time for change is now," said the black guy, yelling at everyone within
earshot for 20 straight minutes, practically begging America for change. "The
need for change is stronger and more urgent than ever before. And only
you—the people standing here today, and indeed all the people of this great
nation—only you can deliver this change." It is estimated that, to date, the
black man has asked every single person in the United States for change.</p>
<p>"I've already seen this guy four times today," Chicago-area ad salesman
Blake Gordon said. "Every time, it's the same exact spiel. 'I need change.' 'I
want change.' Why's he so eager for all this change? What's he going to do
with it, anyway?"</p>
<p>After his initial requests for change, the black man rambled nonstop on a variety of unrelated topics, calling for affordable health care,
demanding that the government immediately begin withdrawing troops from Iraq, and proposing a $75 billion economic stimulus plan to
create new jobs. "What a wacko," Schaumburg, IL resident Patrick Morledge said. "And, of course, after telling us all about how he had the
ability to magically fix everything, he went right back to asking for change. Typical."</p>
<p>"If he's really looking for change, he's got the wrong guy," Morledge added. Reports indicate that the black man has been riding from city
to city across the country, asking for change wherever he goes. Citizens in Austin, TX said they spotted the same guy standing on the
street Friday, shouting far-fetched ideas about global warming. Cleveland residents also reported seeing him in a local park, wildly
gesticulating and quoting from the Bible. And last week, patrons at the Starlight Diner in Cheyenne, WY claimed that the black man
accosted them while they were eating, repeatedly requesting change.</p>
<p>"I saw him walk in and I knew he was headed straight for our table," said mother of three Gladys Davies. "He just stood there smiling at us
for a while, and asked how our food tasted. Then he went and did the same thing at the next table over. The nerve of some people."</p>
<p>Those who encountered the black man Tuesday said he engaged in erratic behavior, including pointing at random people in the crowd and
desperately saying he needs their help, going up to complete strangers and hugging them, and angrily claiming that he is not looking for just
a little bit of change, but rather a great deal of change, and that he wants it "right now."</p>
<p>"I'll be honest, when that black guy said he would 'stop at nothing' to get change, it kind of scared me," local mechanic Phil Nighbert said.
"Just leave me alone."</p>
<p>Though many were taken aback by the black man's brazen demands, some, such as Jackson, MS's Holly Moser, sympathized with him.
She gave the black man credit for boldly standing up and asking every last person around him for change.</p>
<p>"I told him I'd give him some if I saw him later, even though I probably won't," Moser said. "Very nice man, though."</p>
<p>Most, however, ignored his requests.</p>
<p>"I'm a hardworking American who pays his taxes, and the last thing I need is some guy on the street demanding change from me," said
William Overkamp, a Springfield, IL gun-shop owner. He added, "What he really needs is a job."</p>

    <h3>Wealthy Teen Nearly Experiences Consequences</h3>
    <p>SOMERSET, NJ—In what local authorities are calling a "neartragedy," Charles Wentworth, a 17-year-old Rutgers Preparatory senior and member of the affluent Wentworth family,came perilously close to suffering a consequence resulting
from his own wrongdoing Saturday.</p>
<p>Wentworth, reportedly ignoring the protests of his classmates, got behind the wheel of his turbocharged Supra
2000GT after consuming half the contents of a bottle of
Goldschläger at a friend's party. While driving westbound on
Route 27, a disoriented Wentworth drifted across two lanes
of traffic and collided with a minivan carrying a family of four,
bringing the teen face-to-face with a potentially life-altering
lesson.</p>
<p>Wentworth escaped unscathed and unpunished, however, when his airbags deployed and a team of high-powered attorneys rushed to the
scene and rescued him from the brink of personal responsibility. "Amazingly, Mr. Wentworth did not experience a single repercussion for
consuming alcohol under age or operating a motor vehicle while intoxicated, and is furthermore completely unaware that he did anything
wrong," local police chief Marvin Taylor said. "He is a very lucky boy."</p>
<p>"If he had been driving just 5 mph faster, or if his parents hadn't had the influence to keep the matter out of court and the endless financial
resources to lease a car of the exact same make and model to prevent him from having to face even the relatively trivial humiliation of
being taunted by his peers for driving a slightly less expensive vehicle—my God, who knows what could have happened?" Taylor added.
"He could have died or, worse, been held accountable for his actions."</p>
<p>According to police reports that have since been shredded and stricken from Wentworth's permanent record, when briefly taken into
custody, the privileged teenager began swearing, vomiting, and kicking at the windows of the squad car in which he was momentarily
placed following the collision. Wentworth later said the only thing that got him through that dark time was thinking of his rich, well-connected loved ones. With them in mind, he repeatedly shouted, "Don't you know who I am?" and summoned the strength to refuse a field
sobriety test.</p>
<p>"A lot of kids in Charles' situation would have confessed and accepted punishment for their mistake, but my son is strong," said Went
worth's father, aluminum magnate Herman Wentworth, who after arriving at the crash site told his son that "everything is taken care of," and
while Charles sat in his father's BMW texting his friends, loudly threatened to call the police commissioner if any charges were pressed.
"Charles would never allow himself to give up and gain valuable insight into the way things work in the real world without a fight."</p>
<p>District Judge and close friend of the Wentworth family Donald Lamb agreed. "Charles is very lucky to be alive and well-off," Lamb told
reporters. "The fact that he was able to walk away from this crash with no injuries, zero remorse, and his skewed priorities in one piece is a
miracle."</p>
<p>Despite returning to the safety of his $2.3 million home, Wentworth's harrowing brush with consequence was not over</p>
<p>A week after the near ordeal, Wentworth was again put in jeopardy of learning a lesson when he was nearly sentenced to 50 hours of
community service. Tragedy was averted, however, when his mother paid a consultant to testify before the judge that Wentworth had suffered
emotional trauma. Further, during this time, Wentworth was forced to put his video game on pause for several seconds in order to sign
affidavits stating that the Breathalyzer was administered improperly.</p>
<p>"To think that I was that close to seeing that there is an entire society with its own laws and standards outside my protected sphere of wealth
and privilege—it's frightening," Wentworth said. "It almost makes you consider your actions and their impact on others. Almost."</p>
<p>"I'm just grateful I can finally get back to my life as a self-centered prick who believes the entire world revolves around him," Wentworth
added. "After all, I was just admitted to Columbia despite almost failing out of high school because I rarely attended class, and it would have
been a shame to have had to defer for a semester just because of some legal…unpleasantry."</p>
<p>At press time, Wentworth is resting comfortably on a six-figure inheritance in a chaise lounge by his backyard pool. The other four victims of
the crash remain in intensive care at St. Peter's University Hospital, suffering from conditions ranging from poor to lower-class.</p>

    <h3>Nike Recalls Sweat-Wicking Shirts That Pulled Gallons Of Liquid Directly
From Wearers Bodies</h3>
<img src=lab05/images/nike.jpg alt="Nike Running Image"/>
<p>BEAVERTON, OR—Warning customers to return the
garments should they find themselves being drained of all
fluids, Nike recalled thousands of sweat-wicking shirts
Tuesday that inadvertently pulled gallons of liquid directly
from wearers bodies. “If you or anyone you know puts on a
Legend Dri-FIT short-sleeve training shirt and then immediately shrivels into a dried, wrinkled husk, please contact Nike
for a full refund,” said spokeswoman Jessica Garland, who
apologized directly to customers who purchased a
moisture-wicking shirt, only to have every ounce of sweat,
urine, and blood sucked out of their body. “You may think its
okay to wear these shirts for a routine workout at the gym,
but be warned—after five minutes of use, you could lose up
to 40 pounds of water weight. Even if you wear it to sleep,
you could wake up as nothing but a pile of desiccated flesh
lying in a puddle.” At press time, Nike was forced to issue a second apology after news broke of a million-dollar lawsuit alleging their
compression tops had crushed the torsos of athletes into an infinitesimally small speck of dust.</p>
